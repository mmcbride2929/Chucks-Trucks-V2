working on: getting select to send axios request to the backends and sort unchanged

this can be changed with a fetch request that is activated on change of the select then set state


5-13-22

-- get endpoint to show only non working cars on click of btn
-- set state for current sort
-- add context

-- set up in error for when we go to a path that is not created..    


-- custom parameters when looking at single car

-- add loading state to when we are fetching anything 



-- add onSale field for some trucks
 and nest sale price with inventory
-- create 6 more cars



questions:

- how to have unique parameters/link name match the item

- how to lower the amount of routs,by having reverse in the same method

-- on load of the home page we can fetch the inventory with only sales, add the data to an array, and carousel through it.
