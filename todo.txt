-- add loading state to when we are fetching anything 
-- clean up loading screen for single page vehicle



-- all fonts and headers match in size, boldness


-- all padding matches across all pages



questions:

-- is it better practice to fetch only cars that are on sale on backend, or to copy state, and filter them on front end

-- how to have unique parameters/link name match the item (couldn't get items with space in name)

-- how to lower the amount of routs,by having reverse in the same method

-- If I want to display fetched data on both home page & inventory page.. where is the best place to fetch the data? Home.js or App.js?
