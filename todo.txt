-- allow from anywhere MONGO (heroku)
-- What should I do for a contact page/quote page? I want to make a cool form that shows off my skills but not sure of what to make on a website that isn't for a legit business

questions:

-- is it better practice to fetch only cars that are on sale on backend, or to copy state, and filter them on front end

-- how to have unique parameters/link name match the item

-- how to lower the amount of routs,by having reverse in the same method
 
-- If I want to display fetched data on both home page & inventory page.. where is the best place to fetch the data? Home.js or App.js?
